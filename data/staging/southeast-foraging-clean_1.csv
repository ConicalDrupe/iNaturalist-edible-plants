Common Name,Scientific Name,Edible,When and Where
American hazelnut,Corylus americana,['nuts'],"American hazelnut grows in the understory of young, open forests, along fences, at the edge of woods, and in old fields. The husk will still be green when the nuts are ripe. Ripe hazelnuts should be light brown. If you wait until the husks are brown, the nuts will all be gone. Gather hazelnuts in late August and early September."
American lotus,Nelumbo lutea,"['young leaves', 'tubers', 'seeds']","The young lotus leaves should be gathered between April and June when the sides of the leaf are still rolled up. Tubers growing in shallow water ripen in mid-August, while those that grow in deeper water ripen in September or sometimes early October. The seeds ripen from September to October, depending on water depth and weather."
American persimmon,Diospyros virginiana,['fruit'],"American persimmon grows in many different areas: the understory of forests, in full sun, and along roads. Start looking for ripe persimmons in late August. It is a myth that persimmons do not ripen until after frost, but it is true that they do become sweeter from frost. The fruit ripens as the days get shorter. The best fruit can be found in October through November. These persimmons are ripe and ready to eat. The bark of the persimmon tree looks similar to dogwood bark."
Angelica,Angelica,"['young leaves', 'young stem', 'green seeds']","Look for purplestem angelica in swamps and along streambeds or for mountain angelica in the high mountains in woods or in open, rocky areas. Gather the young stem from April to May before the plant starts to bloom, and harvest the leaves at the same time. Gather the seeds while they are still green from June to September."
Apple,Malus,['fruit'],"Typically, apples start to ripen in the Southeast in August and the season goes to October."
Asiatic dayflower,Commelina communis,"['flower', 'leaves', 'stem', 'seeds']","Asiatic dayflower likes damp or disturbed soil and partial shade. It is common in gardens, parks, sidewalks, and shady yards. It is in season throughout the summer and into the early fall."
Asparagus,Asparagus officinalis,['shoots'],"In early spring, asparagus pops up from its perennial roots looking pretty much like its cultivated version. It likes to grow in full to partial sun, in moist soil often at the edges of roads, along fences, at the edge of woods, and in drainage ditches. If asparagus is growing in a garden, chances are there is more nearby that has escaped. The spears of wild asparagus are perfect for harvest in the spring. This wild asparagus has gone to seed. I often come across asparagus when it has gone to seed, because it is easier to notice this way. So I make a note of it and come back the following year, earlier in the spring, to harvest the young spears. Wild asparagus also usually grows one spear, instead of a crown like the cultivated version."
Autumn olive,Elaeagnus umbellata,['berries'],"Autumn olive is a native of Asia, and was introduced into the United States in 1830 for soil improvement, erosion control, landscaping, and wildlife food. Like many imported exotic plants, it soon became invasive. In some parts of the country, it is considered noxious because of its invasiveness. It is one of the few nonlegume plants that fixes nitrogen in the soil. So, look for it in fields where the soil is poor, on eroded hillsides, and around landscaped buildings. The best time to gather the berries is in September, and you can still find lots of ripe fruit into mid-October."
Basswood,Tilia americana,"['young leaves', 'unopened flower buds', 'flowers', 'fruit']","Basswood grows in moist, fertile, well-drained forests. Gather young leaves in early April, harvest the small flowers in mid- to late spring, and collect the pealike seeds in early October."

Whether they are growing in the wild or cultivated, all cherry blossoms look the same."
Black locust,Robinia pseudoacacia,"['flowers', 'green seeds']","Black locust grows along roadsides, in old fields, in urban areas planted as an ornamental, and in the mountains of the Southeast. The flowers start to bloom in April and usually only last for about a week, so cut them when you see them. Start looking for the green seedpods in June. The seeds inside are edible while still green. Once they start to turn brown, they are too tough to eat."
Black mustard,Brassica nigra,"['flower buds', 'flowers', 'leaves', 'root', 'seedpods', 'seeds', 'stalk']","Black mustard loves gardens, fields, and disturbed soil. It starts appearing in September and grows until late May. You can gather black mustard at any time. Once established, it self-seeds prolifically. These unopened flower buds and leaves of black mustard are at the perfect stage for gathering."
Black nightshade,Solanum nigrum,"['leaves', 'berries']","Black nightshade grows as a weed in disturbed soils in partial shade. The greens are in season from late spring until they flower in early summer.

It starts coming up in November, and by December, it is the perfect size for harvesting. It will grow until late spring, when it starts to bloom. Once it blooms and goes to seed, it becomes stringy and unpleasant to eat."
Chicory,Cichorium intybus,"['leaves', 'root', 'flowers']","Chicory grows in fields, disturbed soil, and along roads. The leaves are best in early spring and the root is good at any time before flowering."
Chokeberry,Aronia melanocarpa,['fruit'],"Chokeberry grows in wet, acidic soil in swamps, marshes, bogs, lakeshores, and sometimes dry, sandy soil. You can also find it in urban settings because landscapers often plant the shrubs for their glossy leaves. The berries start to ripen in mid-August and usually last until November. The longer they stay on the bush, the drier they will get, so it is best to pick them as soon as they are ripe."
Cleavers,Galium aparine,"['young leaves', 'stalk', 'seeds']",Cleavers grows in shady areas where the ground has been disturbed. It loves fertile soil like compost piles. Cleavers appears in January and grows until the late summer when it goes to seed. You can gather cleavers at any time up until it blooms.
Common amaranth,Amaranthus retroflexus,"['young leaves', 'young stem', 'seeds']","Common amaranth grows in disturbed soil and especially loves garden soil. As soon as the soil warms, amaranth will spring up. Pick the young leaves and stem in May. Once the flowers start to appear, the stems get too tough to eat.

Field mustard,Brassica rapa,"['flowers', 'seeds', 'seedpods', 'leaves', 'roots']","Field mustard starts appearing in September and grows until late May in fields and open meadows. The greens are best before the plant starts to flower, when they will develop an unpleasant bitterness. Once established, the plant self-seeds prolifically."
Field thistle,Cirsium discolor,"['young leaves', 'stalk', 'root']","Field thistle grows in pastures, fields, and disturbed soil. It starts appearing in the wintertime and grows until the fall. Field thistle spends one or more years as a basal rosette, storing energy, before sending up a flower stalk and dying. The midribs of the leaves are at their best in the spring and fall. The stalk can be gathered in the spring and summer at any time up until the plant produces a flower. The root should be gathered in the fall and should not have a stalk. Every two years, field thistle starts as a basal rosette."
Garlic mustard,Alliaria petiolata,"['young shoots', 'young leaves', 'flower buds']",Garlic mustard grows in rich soil in the understory of forests. The best time to gather is March through May.

Plantain,Plantago,"['leaves', 'seed heads']","The best time to collect young, tender, nonstringy plantain leaves is in early spring to mid-spring, but you can harvest the younger leaves from spring through midsummer. Collect the seed heads of common plantain when they are greenish brown. Also taste the seed heads at different times to find your favorite time to harvest. It’s not really worth collecting English plantain seeds because the seed heads are small and the harvest is labor-intensive."
Pokeweed,Phytolacca americana,['young shoots'],"Pokeweed loves to grow in disturbed soil. It appears in early spring and grows until fall. The best time to gather young pokeweed shoots is in early spring. These pokeweed shoots are perfect for harvesting. Once the pokeweed plant is mature, it is not safe for eating."

The blooms start to appear in mid to late March and last for a few weeks. The strong pink blossoms of the redbud tree are a harbinger of spring. A redbud tree in full bloom is a beautiful sight.
Red clover,Trifolium pratense,['flowers'],"Red clover likes open, sunny areas and can often be found escaped from farm fields. Farmers often plant it as a cover crop because, like other plants in the family Fabaceae, red clover can fix atmospheric nitrogen in the soil and make it biologically available to other plants as a nutrient. It blooms prolifically in mid- to late spring or early summer, then slows down and will bloom sporadically depending on rainfall."
Rose,Rosa,"['flowers', 'hips']","Wild roses love sunny areas at the edge of woods, in flower beds, in disturbed soil, along fence lines, and in open fields.

Harvest the flower stalks when they begin to shoot up but before the flowers open."
Watercress,Nasturtium officinale,['leaves'],"Like all plants growing in water, watercress is only as clean as the water in which it is growing. That is one reason why wild watercress is so hard to find. Often, the water will be polluted with runoff from farm animals or is full of parasites that can make you extremely sick. Have the water tested before harvesting. Some people say that you can boil watercress to remove any impurities, but I prefer watercress raw so I can enjoy the crunchy texture. In the Southeast, watercress appears in November. Look for watercress in ditches, shallow ponds, and spring-fed streams. Watercress can be harvested in the Southeast from November until April when it starts to bloom. After that, the flavor is too strong."
White clover,Trifolium repens,['flower heads'],"Look for white clover in sunny fields and lawns. Gather white clover any time it is in bloom, from April to October. The blooms of white clover are like tiny pom-poms."
Wild carrot,Daucus carota,"['roots', 'young leaves', 'seeds']","Look for wild carrot in sunny fields, in disturbed soils, city lots, and along roadsides. You will also commonly find it in gardens and parks. Gather the leaves from spring through fall. The roots are ready to harvest from fall through early spring. The seeds are ready from late summer through early fall, but they have the best flavor when they are either green or newly turned brown."
Wild ginger,Asarum canadense,"['leaves', 'stems', 'rhizomes']",Wild ginger grows in partial to full shade. It loves moist woodlands. You can collect wild ginger from spring through fall. Wild ginger looks nothing like the cultivated variety.
Wild grape,Vitis,"['fruit', 'leaves']","Wild grapes grow in full to partial sun where they can climb on something, be it a tree or a fence. They frequently grow in and on thickets, by streams and riverbanks, and near the shore. Collect grape leaves when they are big enough to stuff but the veins haven’t become too tough, usually in late spring to early summer. The fruit is ripe from late summer into fall."
Wild lettuce,Lactuca,['leaves'],"Wild lettuce grows in disturbed soil, fields, forests, and gardens. It starts appearing in the fall and slowly grows during the winter, before it really gets going in the spring. The best time to gather wild lettuce is in late winter and early spring."
Wild onion,Allium canadense,"['leaves', 'bulbs', 'flowers', 'seeds']","Wild onions grow in fields, disturbed soil, lawns, and open woods. It starts coming up in the fall and can be harvested during the winter and spring. Be extremely careful about harvesting alliums from vacant lots in a city, because they absorb heavy metals from the soil."
Wild pear,Pyrus pyraster,['fruit'],"Wild pear trees grow in open woods, at the edge of forests, and along fencerows. Start checking on the pears in September. They usually do not ripen until early November. The fruit takes a long time to ripen. The fruit of a wild pear tree is small. The leaves and flowers of wild pear look just like those of a cultivated pear tree."
Wild plum,Prunus americana,['fruit'],Wild plums grow in full to partial sun and love abandoned fields and roadsides. They also grow in hollows and open woodlands. Collect the ripe fruit from August to October. The fruit of this wild plum tree is not ripe yet. The fruit will turn a dark red when ripe. The pale pink flowers of this wild plum tree are in full bloom.
Wild rice,Zizania aquatica,['seeds'],"Wild rice grows in tidal freshwater and brackish marshes, shallow ponds and lakes, rivers, and nontidal marshes. It is usually found in water 1 to 3 feet deep, but it will grow in water up to 5 feet deep. Clean, clear water with a slow current is important to the growth of wild rice because the grains have very little stored energy compared to tubers or rhizomes of aquatic perennials. A wild rice seedling needs to receive enough sunlight to photosynthesize. Most people think of harvesting wild rice in the fall. It actually is ready to harvest in late summer. Start looking for patches or fields of it in early August. Look for husks that are full, and grains that are small and green. You also want to be sure that there is a good quantity of rice kernels that can be harvested in a location or you will be wasting your time. Wild rice usually ripens in late August to early September. There are a great many factors affecting when wild rice ripens—the temperature of the water, the current, how short or tall a plant is, and the type of mud all contribute. Wild rice often grows in a tidal freshwater marsh."
Wild strawberry,Fragaria virginiana,['fruit'],"Wild strawberries like to grow in open, sunny places. They can be found in fields, at the edges of woods, and along roads. Wild strawberries are around for two weeks and then they are done. When they start to bloom, watch them carefully."
Wineberry,Rubus phoenicolasius,['fruit'],"Wineberries grow in full to part sun or occasionally even in part shade. Look for wineberry along roadsides, in parks, and at the edge of fields and clearings. Wineberries are in season in June and July."
Wintergreen,Gaultheria procumbens,"['leaves', 'berries']","Wintergreen is a woodland plant that grows in full to partial shade in moist, acidic soils. Crush the leaves with your hand to release the wintergreen fragrance of the leaves. The leaves can be gathered year-round. Gather the ripe berries from fall to winter."
Wood nettle,Laportea canadensis,"['leaves', 'stem']","Wood nettle grows in damp, rich woods by streams. Gather the leaves of wood nettle in the spring before the plant starts to flower. Wood nettle grows by streams in open woods."
Wood sorrel,Oxalis stricta,"['leaves', 'stems', 'flowers', 'seedpods']","Wood sorrel grows anywhere there is disturbed soil. It starts appearing in late spring as sheep sorrel is on the decline, and grows until late summer."
Yarrow,Achillea millefolium,"['leaves', 'flowers']","Yarrow grows in full sun to partial shade, but you’ll find that it has a stronger flavor growing in full sun as opposed to woodland settings. The roadside plants are usually much smaller, sometimes only a few inches tall, whereas in moist meadows, yarrow can grow up to 3 feet high. The best time to collect yarrow is in the summer. Yarrow often grows by the roadside."
Yellow trout lily,Erythronium americanum,"['flowers', 'corms']","Yellow trout lily grows in fertile, moist woods. The leaves start appearing in early to mid-spring and grow until summer."
